This project is a Machine Learning-based solution to predict the survival of patients diagnosed with liver cirrhosis using real-time clinical data. 
The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk patients for early intervention and personalized care.

Liver cirrhosis is a chronic disease that significantly impacts patient life expectancy. Predicting survival chances based on patient history and current medical features can improve treatment planning. This model aims to predict whether a patient is likely to survive based on medical attributes.
